# Visual analyser

## Introduction

Fluxtion provides a graph visualiser as part of its tool suite. The goal of the visualiser is to allow non-developers to understand the processing logic in the generated SEP. The visualiser provides the following functionality:

* load a graphml generated by fluxtion esc for rendering
* Clearly identify, events, nodes and event handlers
* Inidicate stereotype, class type and instance name
* Indicate event event propagation direction and dependencies
* Search for nodes by name
* Zoom in/out
* Drag and drop loading
* Click node showing execution path memberships
* Double click node shows direct parents and children
* Export current view to png
* Load history for quick graphml loading
* Designed for plugin extension

## Executing visualiser

The visualiser is distributed as an [executable jar](https://github.com/v12technology/fluxtion-visualiser/blob/master/dist/fluxtion-visualiser.jar) located in its dist directory.
