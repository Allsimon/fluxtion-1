# Event processing primitives

This section covers the primitives the developer can use in their code to guide the Fluxtion event stream compiler in event dispatch. In general the primitives take the form of annotations in code to imply the desired event processing. Each page will cover a top level concept and usually an annotation, where appropriate diagrams and pseudo code are employed to illustrate.

This section does not cover [graph construction](../graph-building-primitives.md) or [auditing](../auditing.md) the SEP at runtime.
