# Developer workflow

Creating a Static Event processor involves three distinct phases for a developer:

1.  Definition - User supplied configuration to Fluxtion.
2. Generation - Fluxtion takes the configuration and applies processing inference to generate a static event processor \(SEP\).
3. Integration â€“ Integrate generated SEP into user application or library.

      An example of the steps covered is in the [quick start](../untitled.md) example.
